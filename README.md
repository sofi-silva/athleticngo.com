        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Athletic Projection Network was created to give more people the chance to play sports. We want to help children, teenagers, young adults, and anyone in Argentina who dreams of being an athlete but doesn’t have enough money for training, equipment, competitions, or professional support. We believe talent should not depend on money, but on effort, discipline, and passion.</p>
